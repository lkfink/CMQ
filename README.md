## Description
### Summary
Beyond immediate health risks, the COVID-19 pandemic poses a variety of additional stressors, which may require expensive or unavailable strategies during a pandemic (e.g., therapy, socializing). In this study, we ask whether music might serve as a tool for socio-emotional coping. We surveyed the music listening and making behavior of over 5000 people, with representative samples from 6 countries (3 continents). We find that people with increased positive emotions used music as a proxy for social interaction, whereas people with increased negative emotions used music as a form of emotional regulation. Using a machine learning approach, we tested the importance of demographic/personality traits and various musical behaviors in predicting socio-emotional coping. Our models explain over 50% of the variance in participantsâ€™ self-reported use of music to cope and indicate the importance of individually tailored adaptive behaviors (rather than a one-size-fits-all) approach to using music to meet socio-emotional needs. 

### Main Takeaways

 1. **During the COVID-19 lockdown, people have turned to music for regulating their emotions.**

 2. **People experiencing different degrees of emotional changes showed different patterns of musical engagement.**

 3. **Music listening and music making may provide different coping potentials.**

 4. **Coronamusic played a key role in socio-emotional coping.**
