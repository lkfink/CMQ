## Description
### Summary
Beyond immediate health risks, the COVID-19 pandemic poses a variety of additional stressors, which may require expensive or unavailable strategies during a pandemic (e.g., therapy, socializing). In this study, we ask whether music might serve as a tool for socio-emotional coping. We surveyed the music listening and making behavior of over 5000 people, with representative samples from 6 countries (3 continents). We find that people with increased positive emotions used music as a proxy for social interaction, whereas people with increased negative emotions used music as a form of emotional regulation. Using a machine learning approach, we tested the importance of demographic/personality traits and various musical behaviors in predicting socio-emotional coping. Our models explain over 50% of the variance in participantsâ€™ self-reported use of music to cope and indicate the importance of individually tailored adaptive behaviors (rather than a one-size-fits-all) approach to using music to meet socio-emotional needs. 

### Main Takeaways

 1. **During the COVID-19 lockdown, people have turned to music for regulating their emotions.**

 2. **People experiencing different degrees of emotional changes showed different patterns of musical engagement.**

 3. **Music listening and music making may provide different coping potentials.**

 4. **Coronamusic played a key role in socio-emotional coping.**

**Overview of individual differences in music-related coping, functions, situations, and selection for two latent variables that describe changes in positive and negative emotion during the coronavirus crisis. All values represent mean differences between the top vs. bottom 25% of scorers on each factor (7-point scales). Positive values indicate that the mean score was larger for high scorers than for low scorers.**
